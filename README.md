# Agent Skills

A collection of skills for AI coding agents. Skills are packaged instructions, references, scripts, and templates that extend agent capabilities across picturebook creation, manga production, branding, UI prototyping, subtitle transcription, and subtitle translation workflows.

This repository is designed to host multiple skills that can be activated on demand for specific task domains.

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add nodew/skills
```

## Usage

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent should activate the matching skill when a task falls within that skill's scope.

**Examples:**
```text
Create a fully automated 12-page picturebook about a moon rabbit for ages 4-6 as a PDF.
Turn my cyberpunk ghost story idea into an 8-page black-and-white manga one-shot.
Create a logo system for a developer tool called QuillStack.
Translate the embedded English subtitles in movie.mkv to zh-CN and give me an .srt file.
Transcribe this interview.mp4 into English subtitles and keep the output as .srt.
Create a reusable dashboard prototype in pencil.dev with light and dark themes.
```
