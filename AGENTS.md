# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of skills for AI coding agents. Skills are packaged instructions, references, scripts, and templates that extend agent capabilities across branding, UI prototyping, manga production, subtitle transcription, and subtitle translation workflows.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Optional: executable scripts
      {script-name}.cjs   # Node.js scripts
    references/           # Optional: supporting documentation
      {topic}.md          # Detailed reference material
    templates/            # Optional: starter files and presets
      {name}.json         # JSON templates
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `design-system`, `ui-prototype`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.cjs` or `kebab-case.sh`
- **References**: `kebab-case.md`

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {One sentence describing when to use this skill. Include trigger phrases.}
argument-hint: "[optional argument description]"
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief description of what the skill does.}

## When to Use

{Bulleted list of use cases}

## How It Works

{Numbered list or sections explaining the skill's workflow}
```

### Best Practices for Context Efficiency

Skills are loaded on-demand — only the skill name and description are loaded at startup. The full `SKILL.md` loads into context only when the agent decides the skill is relevant. To minimize context usage:

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — put detailed reference material in separate files under `references/`
- **Write specific descriptions** — helps the agent know exactly when to activate the skill
- **Use progressive disclosure** — reference supporting files that get read only when needed
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — script execution doesn't consume context (only output does)
- **File references work one level deep** — link directly from SKILL.md to supporting files

### Script Requirements

- Node.js scripts use `.cjs` extension with `#!/usr/bin/env node` or are invoked via `node`
- Bash scripts use `#!/bin/bash` shebang with `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `console.error("Message")` or `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Use only Node.js built-ins (`fs`, `path`) — no external dependencies

### Token Architecture Convention

Design tokens follow a three-layer architecture:
1. **Primitive** — raw values (hex colors, rem sizes)
2. **Semantic** — purpose-based aliases (`--color-primary`, `--spacing-md`)
3. **Component** — per-component overrides (`--button-bg`, `--input-border`)

This maps to W3C Design Tokens Community Group JSON format with `$value` and `$type` fields.

## Existing Skills

### draw-a-picturebook
Creates a complete illustrated children's picturebook from an idea. Collects the brief (story direction, age group 1-3/4-6/7-9/10+, art style, page count, aspect ratio, output format), then runs review-gated stages: story (`story.md`) → storyboard (`storyboard.md`) → character designs (`characters/`) → per-page illustrations (`picturebook/1.png`…) → cover (`cover.png`) → merge into PDF or PPTX. Detects an available image generation capability first and asks the user to choose one if none exists.

- Entry: `skills/draw-a-picturebook/SKILL.md`
- Scripts: `merge-pdf.cjs`, `merge-slides.cjs` (lib: `image.cjs`, `zip.cjs`) — pure Node.js built-ins, no dependencies
- References: `brief-age-format-guide.md`, `visual-style-guide.md`, `image-generation-handoff.md`, `character-design-guide.md`

### mangaka
Creates manga, comics, manhua, manhwa, webtoon episodes, one-shots, chapters, or 4-koma from a story idea. Collects the brief (target audience/rating, format, reading direction, art or artist-style reference, black-and-white/color mode, single-page layout preference, page/beat count, lettering route, output format), then runs review-gated stages: treatment (`treatment.md`) → manga script (`script.md`) → `name` storyboard (`name/storyboard.md`) → character designs (`characters/`) → per-page prompts (`prompts/pages/`) → finished pages (`manga/1.png`…) → cover (`cover.png`) → package as images, CBZ, PDF, slides, or prompt pack. Detects image generation and lettering capability first.

- Entry: `skills/mangaka/SKILL.md`
- Scripts: `package-cbz.cjs` (writes `ComicInfo.xml` with reading direction), `merge-pdf.cjs`, `merge-slides.cjs`, `validate-manga-package.cjs` (lib: `image.cjs`, `zip.cjs`) — pure Node.js built-ins, no dependencies
- References: `image-generation-handoff.md`, `manga-storyboard-guide.md`, `visual-style-guide.md`, `lettering-and-sfx-guide.md`, `character-design-guide.md`

### logo-creator
Creates production-ready logo systems from text briefs, reference images, or both. Uses geometric construction principles and a structured generation pipeline (parse → conceptualize → typeface → lockups → build → export) to produce SVG vector logos with raster exports.

- Entry: `skills/logo-creator/SKILL.md`
- Scripts: `export-logo-assets.cjs` (lib: `export-logo-assets-lib.cjs`)
- References: `geometry.md`, `typography.md`, `lockups.md`, `modernism.md`

### pencil-dev
Designs structured product prototypes in pencil.dev and `.pen` files using a token-first, component-first workflow that keeps multi-page products reusable and themeable.

- Entry: `skills/pencil-dev/SKILL.md`

### subtitle-transcribe
Transcribes speech from video or audio files into timed subtitle files using Whisper (openai-whisper by default). Extracts audio via mkvextract (MKV) or ffmpeg (other formats), runs transcription, and delivers SRT/VTT/ASS output. Optionally remuxes back into the video container. GPAC/MP4Box is recommended when MP4/MOV subtitle-like tracks need clearer diagnostics.

- Entry: `skills/subtitle-transcribe/SKILL.md`

### subtitle-translator
Extracts embedded subtitle tracks from video files, translates them via subagents, and optionally remuxes translated subtitles back into the container. Supports MKV, MP4, MOV, M4V, and recommends GPAC/MP4Box when MP4-family subtitle tracks or remux behavior are ambiguous.

- Entry: `skills/subtitle-translator/SKILL.md`
- Scripts: `translate-video-subtitles.cjs`
- References: `subagent-translator-prompt.md`, `subagent-reviewer-prompt.md`, `container-toolchain.md`
