# Subtitle Translator

Extract an embedded subtitle track from a video, translate it to a target language, and deliver a translated subtitle file. Only remux the translated subtitle back into a video container when the user explicitly asks.

Handles subtitle-driven translation only — not dubbing or speech-to-text. If the file has no usable subtitle track, say so explicitly.

## When to Use

- Translate embedded subtitles to another language
- Extract or export subtitle tracks from video files
- Produce translated subtitle files (default) or remux them back into video
- Handle multilingual subtitle workflows across MKV, MP4, MOV, M4V, or other containers

## Core Rules

1. Probe the container and subtitle streams before any action.
2. Default to subtitle-file delivery; only remux when explicitly asked.
3. Never re-encode video or audio unless the user explicitly asks.
4. Never overwrite the original file during processing — write to a temporary or suffixed path first.
5. Preserve timestamps, cue order, and structural markers during translation.
6. Delete temporary intermediate artifacts after success unless the user asks to keep them.
7. Translate with subagents — do not assume an external translator tool is available.
8. Subtitle output naming: `<video-filename>.<target-locale>.<subtitle-ext>` (e.g., `movie.zh-CN.srt`).
9. Remux output: replace the original video file. Write to a temporary path first, then replace the original after validation succeeds.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify that required tools are installed. Check each tool and install any that are missing.

### Node.js

Required to run `scripts/translate-video-subtitles.cjs`.

```bash
# Check
node --version

# Windows (winget)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# macOS
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

### mkvtoolnix (MKV files only)

```bash
# Check
mkvmerge --version

# Windows (winget)
winget install MKVToolNix.MKVToolNix

# macOS
brew install mkvtoolnix

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install mkvtoolnix
```

### ffmpeg / ffprobe (non-MKV files)

```bash
# Check
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version

# Windows (winget)
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### GPAC / MP4Box (recommended for MP4/MOV diagnostics)

MP4Box is not required for every translation run, but it is strongly recommended when MP4/MOV/M4V files have ambiguous subtitle-like tracks or when remux behavior needs to be validated before choosing a container strategy.

```bash
# Check
MP4Box -version

# Windows (winget)
winget install GPAC.GPAC

# macOS
brew install gpac

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gpac
```

If a required tool is missing and cannot be installed, inform the user and either stop with a clear explanation or fall back to a workflow that avoids the missing dependency.

## Subtitle Selection

Priority order:

1. Text-based track matching the user-specified source locale or language tag.
2. Text-based track inferred from title metadata matching the source language.
3. Default full-dialogue track in the source language when several matches exist.
4. Non-forced full-dialogue track over a forced-only track for the same language.
5. If no matching text track exists, ask the user whether to use another language or stop.

Defaults: source locale = `en` when not specified. Accept ISO 639-2 tags (`eng`, `jpn`, `spa`, `zho`).

For subtitle codec types, container capabilities, and toolchain commands, see [references/container-toolchain.md](./references/container-toolchain.md).

## Workflow

### 1. Probe

Run the automation script in `probe` mode or use the appropriate toolchain command. Inspect tracks, codecs, language tags, track names, and default/forced flags.

### 2. Select subtitle stream

Apply the selection priority above. Summarize the chosen stream: index, language, codec, text-based or image-based. If ambiguous, ask one focused question.

### 3. Extract

Run the automation script in `extract` mode or use the appropriate toolchain command. Choose `srt` for broad compatibility or keep `ass`/`ssa` when style preservation matters and the output will remain MKV.

### 4. Translate

Use subagents to translate the extracted subtitle text. The reusable prompt template is in [references/subagent-translator-prompt.md](./references/subagent-translator-prompt.md).

**Chunking strategy:**

- **Small files** (≤ 200 cues): one subagent handles the full file.
- **Medium files** (200–600 cues): split into chunks of ~200 cues, translate in parallel subagents.
- **Large files** (> 600 cues): split into chunks of ~200 cues each, translate all chunks in parallel subagents.
- Always split at cue boundaries — never break mid-cue.
- Each chunk should include 3–5 cues of overlap context from the previous chunk (marked as context-only, not to be translated) so the subagent can maintain continuity of tone, terminology, and character voice across chunk boundaries.
- Merge chunk outputs in original order without adding, dropping, or reordering cues. Remove overlap context lines during merge.
- Delete chunk files after a successful merge unless the user asked to keep them.

**Preservation rules:**

- Cue numbers, timestamps, and structural separators — keep exactly.
- Speaker separation, line breaks, and multi-speaker line splits — preserve as-is.
- Formatting control codes and markup — do not translate as text.
- Subtitle punctuation, music markers, and speaker prefixes — keep when meaningful.
- Follow subtitle-style punctuation norms rather than book-style punctuation. In ordinary dialogue, do not add sentence-final full stops by default, regardless of language, unless clarity or source effect requires it.
- Prefer natural, idiomatic target-language rendering over word-for-word glosses.
- Translate slang and idioms into target-language equivalents — never translate literally.
- Maintain consistent character voice throughout each speaker's lines.

### 5. Review

After translation, launch a reviewer subagent to check and correct the translated output. The reviewer prompt template is in [references/subagent-reviewer-prompt.md](./references/subagent-reviewer-prompt.md).

The reviewer:

- Compares the translated file against the source for context fidelity, idiom handling, character voice consistency, terminology, naturalness, and structural integrity.
- Checks that subtitle-ending punctuation follows subtitle conventions, including avoiding unnecessary sentence-final full stops in ordinary dialogue.
- Produces a corrected subtitle file and a brief review report with correction count and categories.
- If the correction count is zero, the translated file is used as-is.
- If corrections were made, the reviewed file replaces the translated file as the final deliverable.

Stop here if the user only asked for subtitle output.

### 6. Remux (optional)

Skip unless the user explicitly asks for a remuxed video file. Run the automation script in `remux` mode or use the appropriate toolchain command. See [references/container-toolchain.md](./references/container-toolchain.md) for container-specific remux details.

### 7. Validate

**Subtitle-only deliverable:**

1. Translated file exists and is non-empty.
2. Cue numbers, timestamps, and separators preserved.
3. Output path is distinct from the extracted source.
4. Temporary files cleaned up.

**Remuxed video deliverable** (all of the above, plus):

1. Output video file exists and is non-empty.
2. Video and audio streams were copied, not re-encoded.
3. Translated subtitle stream appears with correct language metadata.
4. Any container or styling compromises reported to user.

## Script Reference

`./scripts/translate-video-subtitles.cjs`

Three modes: `probe`, `extract`, `remux`. Requires `mkvtoolnix` for MKV files and `ffprobe`/`ffmpeg` for non-MKV files. Does not handle image-based subtitle OCR or translation — only mechanical extraction and muxing.

Preferred workflow:

1. `probe` — inspect subtitle streams and get a recommended track.
2. `extract` — export the preferred source-language subtitle track.
3. Translate the extracted file with subagents.
4. `remux` — (only if requested) mux the translated subtitle back into the video.
5. Run the script in `remux` mode with `--translated-subtitle` only when the user explicitly wants the translated subtitle added back into a video file.

If subagents are used, the preferred orchestration is:

1. Probe and extract with the helper script when needed.
2. Translate full subtitle files directly with subagents when each file is reasonably sized.
3. For oversized subtitle files, split at cue boundaries, translate chunks in parallel subagents, then merge chunks back into the final subtitle file.
4. Delete temporary extracted subtitle files and chunk files after successful translation when they are no longer needed.

```bash
node skills/subtitle-translator/scripts/translate-video-subtitles.cjs \
  --mode probe \
  --input ./movie.mkv

node skills/subtitle-translator/scripts/translate-video-subtitles.cjs \
  --mode extract \
  --input ./movie.mkv \
  --source-locale en \
  --extract-output ./movie.en.srt

node skills/subtitle-translator/scripts/translate-video-subtitles.cjs \
  --mode remux \
  --input ./movie.mkv \
  --target-locale zh-CN \
  --translated-subtitle ./movie.zh-CN.srt
```

If `--mode` is omitted, the script auto-selects `remux` when `--translated-subtitle` is present, `extract` when `--extract-output` is present, and `probe` otherwise.

Output naming: when `--output` is omitted, derives from the source filename plus target locale suffix (e.g. `movie.es-ES.mkv`). For MKV, MP4, MOV, M4V inputs, keeps the original container. For other containers, defaults to `.mkv`.

## Anti-Patterns

- Guessing subtitle language without probing metadata
- Altering timestamps or cue ordering during translation
- Burning subtitles into video when the user asked for a muxed track
- Remuxing by default when the user only asked for translated subtitle files
- Routing subtitle translation through the current agent or a custom helper script when subagent-based text translation is sufficient
- Leaving extracted source subtitles or temporary chunk files behind after successful translation when the user did not ask to keep them
- Overwriting the source video file
- Promising MP4-family containers will preserve ASS styling
- Treating image-based subtitles as translatable text without OCR
